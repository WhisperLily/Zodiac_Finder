#'menu' is the name of the variable that holds the message and choices to be displayed to a user. 

#3 quotes is used in this case to create a multi-lined string (NOT a comment) for readability.

#2. Read an Integer, which is the choice selected by a user, from console:

#Takes an input from the user, converts the string number to an integer and assign it to a variable named 'choose'.

choose = int(input('Which number has your birth month:'))



#3. Output a predefined message* for the userâ€™s choice:

#Creates a conditional statement; this outputs a predefined message depending on the value inputted by the user.
